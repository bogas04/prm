prm
==

Inspired by [eivind88/prm](https://github.com/eivind88/prm), I decided to build it using NodeJS.
Though it doesn't really do anything better, I just wanted something to play with ES2015.

However, the project does benefit from being a NodeJS module, ***multiplatform support***.

Usage
==
```bash
node prm ls 
node prm add <project-name> <location> 
node prm rm <project-name>
cd $(node prm <project-name>)
```
